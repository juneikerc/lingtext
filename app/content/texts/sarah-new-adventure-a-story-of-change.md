### Chapter 1: A Big Change

Hello! My name is Sarah, and I am twenty-eight years old. Last month, my life changed completely. I lived in London for five years, but I decided to move to a new city. Now, I live in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. Why did I move? Well, I found a new job. I am a graphic designer, and a big company in Edinburgh offered me an excellent position.

Moving to a new city was not easy. First, I had to pack all my clothes, books, and furniture into many cardboard boxes. Then, I rented a large van. My brother drove the van from London to Edinburgh. The journey took about seven hours because there was a lot of traffic on the motorway. When we finally arrived, I was very tired, but I was also incredibly excited.

My new apartment is smaller than my old house, but it is very cozy and comfortable. It is on the third floor, so I have to walk up many stairs every day. However, the view from my window is fantastic. I can see the hills and the historic buildings in the distance. I think I am going to be very happy here.

### Chapter 2: My First Day at Work

My first day at the new office was last Monday. I woke up very early, at six o'clock, because I didn't want to be late. I took a shower, ate some toast, and drank a large cup of coffee. I had to wear smart clothes, so I put on a black skirt, a white blouse, and a new jacket.

I left my apartment at eight o'clock and walked to the bus stop. The office is not very far, but I have to take a bus. When I arrived at the office building, I felt a little nervous. However, everyone was very friendly and welcoming.

My manager's name is David. He showed me my new desk and gave me a new laptop. My desk is near a big window, so I have a lot of natural light. During the morning, I read some documents and learned about the company. At lunchtime, I went to the cafeteria with my new colleagues. We ate sandwiches and talked about our hobbies. I quickly realized that I didn't need to be nervous. The people are great, and the work is very interesting.

### Chapter 3: Exploring the City

Edinburgh is a wonderful city. It is much smaller than London, but I think it is more beautiful. There are two main parts of the city: the Old Town and the New Town. The Old Town has very narrow streets and old, tall buildings. The New Town has wide streets and large gardens.

Last weekend, I decided to explore the city. First, I walked up a big hill to see Edinburgh Castle. It is the most famous building in the city. The castle is very old and impressive. I bought a ticket and went inside. I learned a lot about Scottish history.

After visiting the castle, I walked down a famous street called the Royal Mile. There were many tourists taking photos and buying souvenirs. I listened to a man playing the bagpipes. The bagpipes are a traditional Scottish musical instrument. They are very loud, but the music is quite nice. Later, I drank a cup of tea in a small café. The city is quieter than London, and the air is much cleaner. I love walking around and discovering new places.

### Chapter 4: Meeting New Friends

When you move to a new place, it is very important to make new friends. Fortunately, I have met some lovely people here. My favorite colleague at work is a woman named Fiona. She is Scottish. She has curly red hair and green eyes. Fiona is the funniest person I know. She always tells jokes and makes me laugh when I am stressed.

Fiona has lived in Edinburgh since she was a baby, so she knows everything about the city. She knows the best restaurants and the cheapest shops. Last Friday evening, Fiona invited me to a traditional Scottish pub. I met her group of friends. One of her friends is Liam. He is a teacher. He is taller than me and wears glasses.

Liam likes reading history books and playing the guitar. We talked for hours about our favorite movies and bands. I have only lived here for a month, but I already feel like I have good friends. Having friends makes a new city feel like home. We are planning to go to the cinema next week to watch a new action movie.

### Chapter 5: The Scottish Weather

Before I moved here, my brother told me, "You should buy a good umbrella. The weather in Scotland is terrible!" He was completely right. The weather here changes very quickly. In one day, you can experience all four seasons.

Yesterday is a perfect example. When I woke up in the morning, the sun was shining, and the sky was blue. It looked like a beautiful spring day. I left my apartment wearing a light jacket and sunglasses. However, while I was waiting for the bus, it suddenly became very dark. Thick grey clouds covered the sky. Then, it started to rain heavily. The wind was blowing so hard that my umbrella broke! I arrived at work completely wet.

By lunchtime, the rain had stopped, and it was sunny again. But in the late afternoon, it started to snow! I couldn't believe it. You always have to carry a warm coat and a good umbrella in your bag. In winter, the temperature often drops below zero, and it gets dark very early, at about four o'clock in the afternoon. Although the weather is difficult, it makes the countryside look very green and beautiful.

### Chapter 6: A Trip to the Highlands

Last month, Fiona and I decided to go on a weekend trip. We wanted to leave the city and see the Scottish Highlands. The Highlands are a mountainous region in the north of Scotland. We rented a small car because we wanted to drive through the countryside.

We left Edinburgh on Saturday morning. I was driving while Fiona was reading the map. The journey was amazing. We drove past deep lakes, which the Scottish call "lochs", and huge mountains. The scenery was the most breathtaking I have ever seen.

In the afternoon, we arrived at Loch Ness. This lake is famous because people say a monster lives in the water. We took a boat tour on the lake. We looked closely at the dark water, but unfortunately, we didn't see the monster!

We stayed the night in a small, traditional hotel. We ate a delicious dinner and sat next to a warm fire. On Sunday, we went for a long walk in the hills. The air was cold and fresh. We saw wild deer and many sheep. It was a perfect, relaxing weekend. I will definitely go back to the Highlands next year.

### Chapter 7: A Terrible Cold

Two weeks ago, I felt very ill. I think I caught a cold because I walked in the freezing rain without a warm hat. It started on a Tuesday. While I was working at my computer, I started to sneeze. Then, my throat began to hurt. By the time I went to bed, I had a terrible headache and a high fever.

The next morning, I couldn't get out of bed. I felt weak and tired. I had to call my boss, David. I said, "I'm sorry, David, but I can't come to work today. I am sick." David was very understanding. He said, "Don't worry, Sarah. You should stay in bed and rest. You must not work if you are ill."

I went to the pharmacy near my house. The pharmacist was very helpful. She gave me some medicine for my fever and some special tea for my throat. She advised me, "You should drink a lot of water and eat hot soup. You shouldn't go outside for a few days." I followed her advice. I stayed on my sofa, drank hot tea with lemon and honey, and watched television. After three days, I finally felt better.

### Chapter 8: Food and Cooking

I really enjoy cooking at home. In my old apartment in London, I cooked dinner every night. Here in Edinburgh, I still cook, but I am also trying new types of food. Scottish food is quite different from what I normally eat.

Have you ever tried haggis? Haggis is the most famous Scottish food. It is made of meat, oats, onions, and spices. Before I tried it, I thought it sounded awful. But last week, Fiona invited me to her house for dinner, and she cooked haggis with potatoes and turnips. Surprisingly, it was delicious! It was very rich and full of flavor.

However, I usually prefer simpler meals. On weekdays, I don't have much time. I usually make a quick pasta dish or a chicken salad. I try to eat healthy food, so I buy a lot of fresh vegetables, like carrots, broccoli, and tomatoes. I love shopping at the local market on Saturday mornings. The vegetables at the market are fresher and cheaper than the vegetables in the big supermarkets. Sometimes, I buy a sweet treat, like shortbread. Shortbread is a Scottish biscuit made with a lot of butter. It is perfect with a cup of tea.

### Chapter 9: Shopping for the Apartment

When I moved into my new apartment, it was almost empty. It only had a bed, a small table, and a cooker. I needed to buy some furniture to make it feel like a real home. Last Sunday, I went to a large furniture store on the edge of the city.

First, I needed a sofa for my living room. I looked at many different sofas. The first one I saw was a beautiful leather sofa. However, it was too expensive. It cost over eight hundred pounds! I didn't have enough money for that. Then, I found a lovely grey fabric sofa. It was cheaper, and it was much more comfortable than the leather one. I bought it immediately.

Next, I bought a rug, a floor lamp, and some colorful cushions. I also bought some plates, glasses, and sharp knives for my kitchen. I spent a lot of money, but I was very happy with my purchases. The store delivered the furniture to my apartment two days later. Now, my living room looks fantastic. It is the perfect place to relax after a long, hard day at work.

### Chapter 10: A Special Visitor

Last weekend, I had a very special visitor. My younger sister, Emily, came to visit me from London. She took the train, and I met her at the train station on Friday evening. I was so happy to see her! We hugged and smiled. I hadn't seen her for two months.

On Saturday, I wanted to show her my new city. The weather was actually quite nice, so we decided to walk everywhere. First, I took her to my favorite café for breakfast. We ate pancakes and drank hot chocolate. After breakfast, we went shopping in the city center. Emily bought a beautiful wool sweater, and I bought a new book.

While we were walking through the park in the afternoon, we saw a street artist. He was painting a huge picture on the ground. We stopped and watched him for twenty minutes. It was incredible. In the evening, I cooked a nice dinner at my apartment. We drank a glass of wine and talked about our family and our jobs. On Sunday afternoon, I took her back to the station. I was a bit sad when she left, but she promised to visit me again in the summer.

### Chapter 11: The Arts Festival

Edinburgh is famous all over the world for its festivals. The biggest one happens in August. It is called the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. People from many different countries come to the city to perform and watch shows. There is comedy, theater, music, and dance.

In August, the city completely changes. The streets are extremely busy. Everywhere you look, there are posters for different shows. Last August, I decided to go to as many shows as possible. I bought tickets for a comedy show, a jazz concert, and a magical theater play.

The comedy show was the best. It was in a very small, dark room in the basement of a pub. The comedian was a young man from Australia. He told stories about traveling around the world. He was so funny that I couldn't stop laughing. My stomach actually hurt from laughing so much!

Although the festival is fantastic, it can also be exhausting. There are too many people, and public transport is very slow. Sometimes, it is difficult to walk down the street. However, I think the festival makes Edinburgh the most exciting city in Europe during the summer.

### Chapter 12: A New Hobby

I believe that it is important to learn new things. Because I have more free time in Edinburgh than I had in London, I decided to start a new hobby. Three months ago, I joined a photography class. I have always loved taking photos with my phone, but I wanted to learn how to use a real camera.

I bought a second-hand digital camera online. It was quite complicated at first. There are so many buttons and settings! I didn't know what to do. But my teacher, Mr. Clark, is very patient. He explained how to use the light and how to focus on an object.

Every Wednesday evening, I go to the class for two hours. We learn the theory in the classroom, and then we go outside to practice. I love taking photos of nature and architecture. Last week, I took a stunning photo of Edinburgh Castle at sunset. The sky was pink and purple. I showed the photo to Fiona, and she said, "Wow, Sarah! This is beautiful. You should print it and put it on your wall." I think I will do that. Photography is definitely my new passion.

### Chapter 13: A Problem at Work

Not everything in my new life is perfect. Sometimes, I have difficult days. Last Tuesday, I had a big problem at work. I was working on a very important design project for a new client. The deadline was five o'clock in the afternoon.

At two o'clock, while I was saving my work, my computer screen suddenly went black. I tried to turn it on again, but nothing happened. I was terrified! I hadn't saved the final version of the document. I felt stressed and worried. I thought, "I am going to lose all my hard work!"

I immediately called the IT department. A technician named Paul came to my desk. He looked at the computer, pressed a few buttons, and shook his head. "The hard drive is broken," he said. I wanted to cry. But Paul said, "Don't panic. I think I can recover your files." He took the computer to his office. I waited nervously for an hour. Finally, Paul returned with a USB drive. He smiled and said, "I have your project here." I was so relieved! I thanked him, finished my work on another computer, and sent the project to the client just in time.

### Chapter 14: Technology and Modern Life

That problem at work made me think about technology. We depend on technology for almost everything today. When my parents were young, they didn't have laptops, smartphones, or the internet. If they wanted to talk to a friend, they had to use a home phone or write a letter. Now, communication is instant.

I use my smartphone constantly. I use it to check the weather, read the news, and find directions on a map. I also use social media to stay connected with my friends in London. We send each other funny videos and photos every day.

The best thing about technology is video calling. Because my family lives far away, I can't see them very often. But every Sunday evening, I have a video call with my parents. I can see their faces and show them my apartment. It is much better than a normal phone call.

However, technology can also be a bad thing. Sometimes, people spend too much time looking at screens. They forget to talk to the people sitting next to them. I try to turn off my phone for a few hours on the weekend. I prefer to read a paper book or go for a walk in nature.

### Chapter 15: Plans for the Future

I have been living in Edinburgh for six months now. The time has passed very quickly. I have experienced many new things, met wonderful people, and learned a lot about myself. I am very proud of my decision to move here.

What am I going to do in the future? Well, I have a few plans. Next year, I am going to buy a car. Renting a car for trips is expensive, and I want to explore more of Scotland. I want to drive to the Isle of Skye. They say it is the most beautiful island in the country.

Also, I will probably ask my boss for more responsibility at work. I want to be a senior designer in a few years. I know I have to work hard, but I am ready for the challenge.

Finally, I want to travel outside of the UK. I have never been to Italy, and I would love to visit Rome and Florence. I am going to save money every month for that trip. Life is an adventure, and I am excited to see what happens next. Thank you for reading my story!
