**Alex:** It’s interesting how much programming has changed in the last few years. Sometimes I feel that what we learned at university is no longer enough.
**Marta:** I feel the same. Artificial intelligence has completely transformed the way we think about software development. Writing code is still important, but it’s no longer the only core skill.

**Alex:** Exactly. Many people think that AI will replace programmers, but I don’t really agree with that idea.
**Marta:** Neither do I. I think the role of the engineer is changing, not disappearing. A good engineer today needs to understand how to work _with_ AI, not compete against it.

**Alex:** That’s a good way to put it. Instead of writing every single line of code by hand, we are starting to guide systems that can generate code, test it, and even improve it.
**Marta:** Yes, and that’s where the idea of the engineer as an “orchestrator” comes in. We are no longer just builders; we are coordinators of intelligent agents.

**Alex:** When you say “orchestrator of agents,” what do you mean exactly?
**Marta:** I mean that modern systems are made of many AI components: code generators, testing agents, monitoring agents, and even agents that communicate with users. Someone has to decide how all these parts work together.

**Alex:** So instead of focusing only on algorithms, we focus more on system design and decision-making.
**Marta:** Precisely. A strong engineer understands the problem, chooses the right tools, and defines how AI agents interact to solve that problem efficiently and safely.

**Alex:** That also means understanding the limitations of AI.
**Marta:** Absolutely. AI is powerful, but it’s not magic. It can make mistakes, misunderstand context, or produce solutions that look correct but are actually wrong.

**Alex:** That’s why human judgment is still critical. An AI can suggest solutions, but a human engineer must evaluate them.
**Marta:** Yes, and that evaluation requires deep knowledge: not just programming languages, but also architecture, ethics, and even communication skills.

**Alex:** Communication is often underestimated in engineering.
**Marta:** True, but when you orchestrate agents, you’re also translating human goals into instructions that machines can follow. That’s a form of communication.

**Alex:** Prompt design is a good example of that. Writing a good prompt is similar to writing good specifications.
**Marta:** Exactly. A vague prompt gives vague results, just like vague requirements lead to bad software.

**Alex:** Do you think traditional coding skills are becoming less important?
**Marta:** I wouldn’t say less important, but they are no longer sufficient on their own. You still need to read code, debug it, and understand performance. But now you also need to manage complexity at a higher level.

**Alex:** That higher level is more strategic.
**Marta:** Yes. Instead of asking “How do I implement this function?”, we ask “Which agent should do this, and how should it interact with the rest of the system?”

**Alex:** That also changes how teams work.
**Marta:** Definitely. Teams are becoming smaller but more focused. One engineer with good AI tools can do the work that previously required several people.

**Alex:** That can be scary for some professionals.
**Marta:** It can, but it also creates opportunities. Engineers who adapt can focus on more meaningful problems instead of repetitive tasks.

**Alex:** Repetitive coding was never the most creative part of the job anyway.
**Marta:** Exactly. AI frees us from that and allows us to think more about design, impact, and long-term consequences.

**Alex:** Speaking of consequences, what about responsibility? If an AI agent makes a mistake, who is responsible?
**Marta:** That’s a crucial question. In the end, responsibility lies with the human engineer and the organization. That’s another reason why orchestration skills matter.

**Alex:** Because the orchestrator decides which agent to trust and how much autonomy to give it.
**Marta:** Right. A good engineer knows when to let AI act independently and when to require human approval.

**Alex:** This reminds me of conducting an orchestra. Each musician is skilled, but without a conductor, the result can be chaotic.
**Marta:** That’s a perfect metaphor. AI agents are powerful musicians, but they need direction to create something meaningful.

**Alex:** And the conductor must understand music deeply, not just wave their hands.
**Marta:** Exactly. Similarly, an engineer must understand both the technical and conceptual aspects of the system.

**Alex:** How do you think education should change to prepare engineers for this future?
**Marta:** I think we need less focus on memorizing syntax and more on problem-solving, systems thinking, and ethics.

**Alex:** Ethics is a big one.
**Marta:** Yes. AI systems can affect millions of people. Engineers must think about bias, transparency, and social impact.

**Alex:** That’s another role AI cannot replace easily: moral responsibility.
**Marta:** Agreed. AI can optimize for objectives, but humans must choose the right objectives.

**Alex:** So, in the end, programming in the age of AI is not about writing less code, but about making better decisions.
**Marta:** Exactly. The best engineers of the future will not be those who type the fastest, but those who think the clearest.

**Alex:** And those who can guide intelligent systems toward useful and responsible outcomes.
**Marta:** Well said. Being an orchestrator of AI agents is not a loss of skill; it’s an evolution of the profession.

**Alex:** That actually makes me excited about the future of engineering.
**Marta:** Me too. It’s a challenging time, but also a very creative one.
