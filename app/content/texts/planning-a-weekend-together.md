**Laura:** Hi Mark, how are you today?
**Mark:** Hi Laura, I’m doing well, thank you. I feel a bit busy, but also relaxed. How about you?
**Laura:** I’m fine too. This week was long, so I’m happy it’s almost the weekend.
**Mark:** I feel the same. The weekend is a good time to rest and do nice things.

**Laura:** Do you already have plans for the weekend?
**Mark:** Not really. I have some ideas, but nothing is decided. What about you?
**Laura:** I have free time on Saturday, but on Sunday I visit my parents.
**Mark:** That sounds nice. Do they live near here?
**Laura:** Yes, they live about thirty minutes away by bus. I go there almost every Sunday.

**Mark:** That’s good. Family time is important. On Saturday, maybe we can do something together.
**Laura:** Yes, I would like that. What do you suggest?
**Mark:** Well, the weather forecast says it will be sunny. Maybe we can go outside.
**Laura:** Sunny weather is perfect. We could go to the park or walk around the city.

**Mark:** I like walking in the city, but the park is quieter.
**Laura:** True. In the park we can relax and talk.
**Mark:** Also, we can bring some food and have a small picnic.
**Laura:** A picnic sounds great. I can prepare some sandwiches.
**Mark:** That would be very nice. I can bring some drinks.

**Laura:** What time do you want to meet?
**Mark:** Maybe in the morning, around ten o’clock.
**Laura:** Ten is fine for me. I usually wake up early on Saturdays.
**Mark:** Me too. I like to start the day early, so I can enjoy it more.

**Laura:** Do you like cooking, Mark?
**Mark:** Yes, I like cooking, but I’m not very good at it. I cook simple meals.
**Laura:** Simple meals are fine. Cooking is fun when you don’t feel stressed.
**Mark:** Exactly. During the week I’m too tired to cook something special.

**Laura:** What do you usually do after work?
**Mark:** After work, I go home, have dinner, and sometimes watch a series.
**Laura:** Do you watch series often?
**Mark:** Yes, especially in the evening. It helps me relax. And you?
**Laura:** I read books or listen to music. Sometimes I watch movies.

**Mark:** What kind of books do you like?
**Laura:** I like novels and travel books. I enjoy reading about different countries.
**Mark:** That’s interesting. Do you like to travel?
**Laura:** Yes, I love traveling, but I don’t do it very often. It can be expensive.
**Mark:** That’s true. I also like traveling, but I prefer short trips.

**Laura:** Where was your last trip?
**Mark:** Last year I went to a small town near the sea. It was calm and beautiful.
**Laura:** That sounds lovely. I like the sea too.
**Mark:** The sea is relaxing. I like to walk on the beach and listen to the water.

**Laura:** Maybe one day we can travel together.
**Mark:** That would be nice. Maybe a short trip first.
**Laura:** Yes, a short trip is a good idea.

**Mark:** Coming back to Saturday, should we invite more people?
**Laura:** Maybe just us this time. A quiet day is good.
**Mark:** I agree. Sometimes it’s nice to keep things simple.

**Laura:** Do you have any hobbies, Mark?
**Mark:** Yes, I like photography. I take photos of the city and nature.
**Laura:** Really? That’s great. You can bring your camera to the park.
**Mark:** Good idea. I can take some photos while we walk.

**Laura:** I don’t have a camera, but I like taking photos with my phone.
**Mark:** That’s fine. Phone cameras are very good now.
**Laura:** Yes, and it’s easy to share photos with friends.

**Mark:** Do you use social media a lot?
**Laura:** Not too much. I use it to talk to friends and see photos.
**Mark:** Same here. I try not to spend too much time online.

**Laura:** That’s healthy. It’s important to enjoy real life too.
**Mark:** I completely agree.

**Laura:** So, let’s meet on Saturday at ten in the morning, at the park entrance.
**Mark:** Perfect. Which entrance? The one near the café?
**Laura:** Yes, that one. It’s easy to find.
**Mark:** Great. I’ll be there on time.

**Laura:** What if the weather changes and it rains?
**Mark:** Good question. If it rains, we can go to a museum or a café.
**Laura:** I like that plan. There is a nice museum near the park.
**Mark:** Yes, I know it. I haven’t been there for a long time.

**Laura:** Then we have a plan for sunny weather and for rain.
**Mark:** Exactly. We are well prepared.

**Laura:** I’m really looking forward to Saturday.
**Mark:** Me too. It will be a nice break from the week.
**Laura:** Thanks for making the plan with me.
**Mark:** Thank you too, Laura. I’m sure it will be a great day.

**Laura:** See you on Saturday, then.
**Mark:** See you on Saturday. Have a good evening.
**Laura:** You too. Bye!
**Mark:** Bye!
