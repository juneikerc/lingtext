Last summer, I went to London with my best friend, Sarah. We had been planning this trip for over a year, and we were very excited when the day finally arrived. We stayed there for five wonderful days. London is a very big, busy, and interesting city with so much history and culture to explore.

Our journey started at the airport. We were a bit nervous because it was our first time traveling to a different country without our parents. However, everything went smoothly. We arrived at Heathrow Airport in the afternoon. The airport was huge, and there were people from all over the world. We took the Underground, which people in London call "the Tube," to get to our hotel. The hotel was located in a nice area called Kensington. It was small but very clean and comfortable.

On the first day, we visited Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. These are very famous landmarks in London. The architecture was amazing, and it felt like being in a movie. The weather was typical for England—it rained a little bit in the morning, but we didn't mind because we had our umbrellas. We took many photos in front of the clock tower. After that, we walked across Westminster Bridge. The view of the River Thames was beautiful. We saw the big red buses and the black taxis that London is famous for.

In the afternoon, we visited the British Museum. This museum is enormous and contains many old things from different countries and different times in history. We saw the Rosetta Stone and the Egyptian mummies. It was fascinating to learn about ancient civilizations. We spent about three hours there, but we could have stayed much longer. By the time we left, our feet were quite tired, so we found a small cafe nearby and had some tea and cake.

The next day, we decided to explore the shopping areas. We went to Oxford Street and Regent Street. There were so many shops and people! We spent some time in a very large toy shop called Hamleys. Even though we are not children anymore, we had a lot of fun looking at all the toys and games. After shopping, we went to Piccadilly Circus. It reminded me of Times Square in New York because of all the bright advertisements and the crowds of people.

One of my favorite parts of the trip was visiting the London Eye. It is a giant observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames. We had booked our tickets in advance, so we didn't have to wait in a long line. As the wheel turned slowly, we rose higher and higher. The view of the city from the top was absolutely amazing. We could see for miles in every direction. We tried to spot all the places we had already visited. It was a very peaceful experience despite being in such a busy city.

For dinner that evening, we went to a traditional English pub. We wanted to try the famous fish and chips. The food was delicious! The fish was crispy and the chips were thick and hot. We also tried some mushy peas, which is a common side dish in England. It was a very authentic experience, and the atmosphere in the pub was very friendly. People were talking and laughing, and there was a feeling of warmth and community.

On the fourth day, we went to see the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. This is a very popular event, so we arrived early to get a good spot. We saw the soldiers in their red uniforms and tall black hats. They marched in perfect time to the music of a military band. It was very impressive and full of tradition. After the ceremony, we walked through St. James's Park. The park was very green and there were many squirrels and ducks. We sat on a bench for a while and enjoyed the sunshine.

In the evening, we went to the West End to see a musical. London is famous for its theaters, and we had tickets for "The Lion King." The performance was incredible! The costumes, the music, and the acting were all top-quality. We were both moved by the story, and we sang the songs for the rest of the night. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.

On our last day, we visited the Tower of London. This is a historic castle with a very interesting and sometimes scary history. We saw the Crown Jewels, which were incredibly sparkly and beautiful. We also went on a tour with a Yeoman Warder, also known as a Beefeater. He told us many stories about the kings, queens, and prisoners who had lived in the tower hundreds of years ago. It was a great way to end our visit to London.

Before heading back to the airport, we went to a local market to buy some souvenirs for our families. I bought a small model of a red bus and a Union Jack t-shirt. Sarah bought some English tea and some postcards. We were sad to leave London, but we were also happy to have so many wonderful memories. We promised each other that we would come back again someday.

London is a city that has something for everyone. Whether you like history, shopping, theater, or food, you will find it there. The people are helpful, and the public transport is very efficient. I learned a lot during my five days in London, and I feel more confident about traveling now. It was a truly unforgettable experience that I will cherish forever. The trip made me realize how big and diverse the world is, and it inspired me to want to visit even more countries in the future. Until next time, London! Goodbye!
