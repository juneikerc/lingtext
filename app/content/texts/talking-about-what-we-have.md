**Emma:** Hi Tom, do you have a minute?
**Tom:** Yes, I have some time now. What do you want to talk about?
**Emma:** I want to practice English, especially the verb _to have_.
**Tom:** That’s a good idea. I think I need more practice too.

**Emma:** Let’s start with something easy. What do you have in your bag today?
**Tom:** I have my laptop, a notebook, and two pens.
**Emma:** I have a notebook too, but I don’t have a laptop with me.
**Tom:** Do you have your phone?
**Emma:** Yes, I have my phone in my pocket.

**Tom:** Do you have any plans for today?
**Emma:** Yes, I have a meeting this afternoon.
**Tom:** I don’t have a meeting today. I have free time after work.
**Emma:** That’s nice. I usually don’t have much free time during the week.

**Tom:** How many brothers or sisters do you have?
**Emma:** I have one brother and one sister. What about you?
**Tom:** I have two sisters, but I don’t have any brothers.
**Emma:** Do they live near you?
**Tom:** One sister lives near me, but the other one lives in another city.

**Emma:** When you were a child, did you have a pet?
**Tom:** Yes, I did. I had a dog when I was ten years old.
**Emma:** Really? I didn’t have a dog, but I had a small cat.
**Tom:** Did you have a favorite toy?
**Emma:** Yes, I had a big teddy bear. I had it for many years.

**Tom:** What do you have to do tomorrow?
**Emma:** Tomorrow I have to wake up early because I have an exam.
**Tom:** Oh, good luck! I don’t have to work tomorrow, so I can sleep more.
**Emma:** You’re lucky. I always have to study before exams.

**Tom:** Do you have any hobbies?
**Emma:** Yes, I have a few hobbies. I have a guitar, and I like music.
**Tom:** I don’t have a guitar, but I have a bicycle.
**Emma:** That’s great. Do you have time to ride it often?
**Tom:** Yes, I usually have time on the weekend.

**Emma:** What about your house? What do you have there?
**Tom:** I have a small apartment. I have one bedroom and a living room.
**Emma:** I have a small apartment too, but I have two bedrooms.
**Tom:** Do you have a balcony?
**Emma:** No, I don’t have a balcony, but I have big windows.

**Tom:** How is your week going so far?
**Emma:** It has been busy. I have had a lot of work these days.
**Tom:** I understand. I have had a busy week too.
**Emma:** Have you had any problems at work?
**Tom:** No, I haven’t had any big problems, just small ones.

**Emma:** That’s good. Sometimes I have trouble with time management.
**Tom:** Me too. I often feel like I don’t have enough time.
**Emma:** I think everyone has that problem.

**Tom:** Do you think you have improved your English?
**Emma:** Yes, I think I have improved a little.
**Tom:** I agree. We have had good practice today.
**Emma:** Yes, we have had a very useful conversation.
